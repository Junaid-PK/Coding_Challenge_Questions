## Folder Name: ValidSubsequence

##### Given two non-empty arrays of integers. write a function that determines vfiether the second array is a subsequence of the first one. A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [I, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [I, 2, 3, 4] , and so dothe numbers [2, 4] . Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
