## Folder Name: ValidSubsequence

##### Given two non-empty arrays of integers. write a function that determines vfiether the second array is a subsequence of the first one. A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [I, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [I, 2, 3, 4] , and so do the numbers [2, 4] . Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

## Folder Name: SortedSquaredArray

##### Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

## Folder Name: TournamentWinner

##### There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible. Tearns compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time. and for each competition, one team is designated the home team. while the other team is the away team. In each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and O points if it loses. The winner of the tournament is the team that receives the rnost amount of points. 
##### Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competed against each other and an array containing the results of each competition, write a function that returns the winner of the tournament. The input arrays are named competitions and results , respectively. The competitions array has elements in the form of [homeTeam, awayTeam] , where each team is a string of at most 30 characters representing the name of the team. The results array contains information about the winner of each corresponding competition in the competitions array. Specically, results[i] denotes the winner of competitions[i] , where a 1 in the results array means that the home team in the corresponding competition won and a 0 means that the away team won. 

##### It's guaranteed that exactly one team will win the tournament and that each team will compete against all other teams exactly once. It's also guaranteed that the tournament will always have at least two teams.

## Folder Name: Non-ConstructibleChange

##### Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value). For example, if you're given coins = [1, 2, 5] , the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 4 . If you're given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 1 .

## Folder Name: SubarraySort

##### Write a function that takes in an array of at least two integers and that returns an array of the starting and ending indices of the smallest subarray in the input array that needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input array to be sorted (in ascending order). If the input array is already sorted, the function should return [-1, -1] .

## Folder Name: LargestRange

##### Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length 2 representing the largest range of integers contained in that array. The rst number in the output array should be the rst number in the range, while the second number should be the last number in the range. A range of numbers is dened as a set of numbers that come right after each other in the set of real integers. For instance, the output array [2, 6] represents the range {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , which is a range of length 5. Note that numbers don't need to be sorted or adjacent in the input array in order to form a range. You can assume that there will only be one largest range.

## Folder Name: LinkedListConstruction

##### Writea DoublyLinkedList class that hasa head anda tail both ofwhich point to either a linked list Node or None / null . The class should support:
• Setting the head and tail of the linked list.
• Inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at given positions (the position of the head node is 1 ). 
• Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values. 
• Searching for nodes with given values. 
Note that the setHead , setTaiI , insertBefore , insertAfter , insertAtPosition , and remove methods all take in actual Node sas input parameters —not integers (except for insertAtPosition , which also takes in an integer representing the position); this means that you don't need to create any new Node s in these methods. The input nodes can be either stand-alone nodes or nodes that are already in the linked list. If theyre nodes that are already in the linked list, the methods will effectively be movingthe nodes within the linked list. You won't be told if the input nodes are already in the linked list, so your code will have to defensively handle this scenario. If you're doing this problem in an untyped language like Python or JavaScript you may want to look at the various function signatures in a typed language like Java or TypeScript to get a better idea of what each input parameter is. 
Each Node has an integer value as well asa prev node anda next node, both of which can point to either another node or None / null .
